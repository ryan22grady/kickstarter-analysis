# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis to inform Louise on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis used two methods to evaluate how different campaigns in relation to one another: launch date and goals. While the criteria illustrated some trends, they also suggested some challenges.   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To begin this analysis it was necessary to add a column of years to original Kickstarter data. This was done using the YEARS() function so that is could be an additional variable when evaluating the "Date Created" Column. Next, a pivot table was created to further analysis success in relation to launch date.
